  description="This book is a companion to my Democracy Redefined: Michel Chiha and the Lebanese Constitution (MCLC). It also stands alone. The documents represent the full facsimile set of Michel Chiha’s Constitutional Papers (CCP), from December 1925, when he started working on the draft, to late May 1926 when the Lebanese Constitution was adopted by the members of the Council of Representatives. Thanks to the Chiha Foundation, a unique archive of papers on the Lebanese Constitution is now available to a wide public."
